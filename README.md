# wheelie

wheelie is a lightweight JavaScript library that converts a regular `<select>` element into a touch-friendly spinning wheel. It supports wide browser compatibility and updates the original `<select>` element upon selection so that values are correctly submitted in forms.

## Features

- Touch-friendly wheel/spin select interface.
- Converts an existing `<select>` element without affecting form submissions.
- Updates the underlying `<select>` so that forms submit the correct value.
- Fully configurable (e.g., option height).
- Old-fashioned JS + CSS â€“ no frameworks needed!

## Installation

Download the latest release from GitHub and include the CSS and JS files in your project:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="wheelie.css">
<script src="wheelie.js"></script>
